# My Portfolio Website

This is my repository for my portfolio website. This is the first time I have used [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) as the core of the project. Grav is a flat file CMS that is build to be fast.  

The underlying architecture of Grav is designed to use well-established and _best-in-class_ technologies to ensure that Grav is simple to use and easy to extend. Some of these key technologies include:

* [Twig Templating](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/): for powerful control of the user interface
* [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown): for easy content creation
* [YAML](http://yaml.org): for simple configuration
* [Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/): for fast Markdown and Markdown Extra support
* [Doctrine Cache](http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.io/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/caching.html): layer for performance
* [Pimple Dependency Injection Container](http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/): for extensibility and maintainability
* [Symfony Event Dispatcher](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/event_dispatcher/introduction.html): for plugin event handling
* [Symfony Console](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html): for CLI interface
* [Gregwar Image Library](https://github.com/Gregwar/Image): for dynamic image manipulation
