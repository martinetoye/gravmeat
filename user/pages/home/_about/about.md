<span class="about__title--intro--bold">Hello everyone</span><span class="about__title--intro">, My name is Martin Toye</span>

I am a Front End Developer from Banstead, Surrey. I was working in the transport industry but have since changed direction. I have always been interested in web development which I have self taught for a number of years. My mission now is to become a <strong>Freelance Frontend Developer</strong>.

If you are looking for some additional help with a project then I would love to hear from you. Why not take a look at my resume and click the hire me button at the top.

I sure hope you like my site.
